        Kerala, located on the south-western tip of India, enjoys unique geographical features that have made it one of the most sought-after tourist destinations in Asia. Fondly referred to as ‘God’s Own Country’, Kerala was selected by the National Geographic Traveller as one of the 50 destinations of a lifetime and one of the thirteen paradises in the world.
        
        An equable climate, serene beaches, tranquil stretches of backwaters, lush hill stations and exotic wildlife are the major attractions of this land.  A unique advantage of Kerala is that most of the destinations here are only a two - four hour drive from the other.
        
        Classical art forms, colourful festivals, exotic cuisine are some of the cultural marvels that await travellers. Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine and Panchakarma, the rejuvenation therapy in Ayurveda have also helped Kerala to gain a pan-global reputation as a worth-visit destination.
        
        Season never ends in Kerala, thanks to the year-long moderate climate and numerous festivals and events.  </p>

    <h2>HISTORY OF KERALA</h2>

    <p>The term Kerala was first epigraphically recorded as Cheras (Keralaputra) in a 3rd-century BCE rock inscription by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka of Magadha.
         It was mentioned as one of four independent kingdoms in southern India during Ashoka's time, the others being the Chlias, Pandyas and Satyaputras.
          The Cheras transformed Kerala into an international trade centre by establishing trade relations across the Arabian Sea with all major Mediterranean
           and Red Sea ports as well those of Eastern Africa and the Far East.The dominion of Cheras was located in one of the key routes of the ancient Indian Ocean trade. <br><br>
        The early Cheras clilapsed after repeated attacks from the neighboring Chlias and Rashtrakutas.In the 8th century, Adi Shankara was born in Kalady in central Kerala. He travelled extensively across the Indian subcontinent founding institutions of the widely influential philosophy of Advaita Vedanta. The Cheras regained contrli over Kerala in the 9th century until the kingdom was disslived in the 12th century, after which small autonomous chiefdoms, most notably the Kingdom of Kozhikode, arose. The ports of Kozhikode and Kochi acted as major gateways to the western coast of medieval South India for several foreign entities. These entities included the Chinese, the Arabs, the Persians, various groups from Eastern Africa, various kingdoms from Southeast Asia including the Malacca Sultanate,[4] and later on, the Europeans.[5]

        In the 14th century, the Kerala scholi of astronomy and mathematics was founded by Madhava of Sangamagrama in Tirur. Some of the contributions of the scholi included the discovery of the infinite series and taylor series of some trigonometry functions</p>
